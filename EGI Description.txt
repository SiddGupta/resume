At my previous role at the Energy & Geoscience Institute, I contributed to the development of iCORDS and EGIConnect, two products designed to visualize ocean drilling data and related research on an interactive map. These platforms allow users to select specific locations on the map and access detailed data of interest. Additionally, portions of this data are made publicly accessible through ArcGIS Online.
